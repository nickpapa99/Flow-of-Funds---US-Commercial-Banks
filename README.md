# ECON 451: Analysis of Flow of Funds Account L.111: U.S.-Chartered Depository Institutions

## Overview

### Project Description: Analysis of Macroeconomic Statistical Data and Visualizations

This project focuses on analyzing macroeconomic data from the Flow of Funds Accounts, with a particular emphasis on the U.S. commercial banking sector. By exploring the sectorâ€™s assets and liabilities over time, the study seeks to uncover key trends in bank balance sheets and their role in the broader economy. Through comprehensive statistical analysis and visualizations, including line plots, bar charts, and treemaps, the project examines the composition of bank assets and liabilities, the long-term vs. short-term nature of these financial components, and how they evolve in response to macroeconomic events such as recessions or financial crises.

Key observations include the predominance of long-term assets and liabilities, the role of deposits in financing, and the impact of monetary policy and economic programs. Furthermore, the project provides insights into the relationships between banks and key stakeholders, such as households and non-financial businesses, highlighting the interconnectedness of the financial system.

This analysis not only enhances understanding of the banking sector's influence on economic stability and growth but also demonstrates the power of data visualization in elucidating complex financial trends.
